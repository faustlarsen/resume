      and I love to solve problems. For the past decade I’ve been helping different businesses to systematize their 
      processes to become more efficient. From financial services to small businesses there were always things to improve. 
      However, the moment the issue was eradicated i'd have a need to switch my attention over to the next problem. 
      After doing some research I found that programming in itself is an ultimate puzzle,
      as well as, a tool to provide all sort of solutions for an array of issues. Aside from programming, 
      I’m obssesed with an idead of longevity. So in order to keep my mind sharp and my body healthy there is a certain 
      routine that i constantly do in order to live as long as I possibly can. It includes cold showers, exercising, breathing 
      techniques, fasting, clean diet and meditation. For fun I play video games, read books and watch movies.
